            <p class="text">Moona Island was first discovered by Jed Yang in 2021 as he was cruising the open waters 400 nautical miles from the coast of Hawaii. As he approached the island, he noticed that it seemed deserted. Proceeding to take a closer look at the island, he realized that there was indeed no one on the island and claimed it for himself. The island had many natural attractions such as volcanoes, waterfalls, and a sophisticated river system that can take you around the island. Over the next 30 years he built the island from the ground up, creating an airport, establishing a government, and building communities on the island for his friends and newcomers. Today, Moona Island has become a populous island with over 10 million inhabitants. Jed is currently the President of the island and has created a very successful economy for the people.</p>
